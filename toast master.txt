HI everybody.
This is my first time to give you guys a speech for Toast Master. I¡¯ve spent a lot of time last two weekends to think about a theme to prepare, actually, I find that it is more difficult to do it than to just talk about it.  
At the same time, when my teacher urged me to finished my thesis , i start to worry about it, because of the limited time and vert little work have done.
there is a very intresting phenomeno.we usually think things more simple and do not take care of something which seems not very important or crucial in our daily life.

So I am just wondering whether our guys take care of some essential business concepts?
we all know that we are working in an investment bank.
so what is investment bank?

yes , sure .We can get some information from the literal meaning,investment could be making money. but it is not enough for us to get a better understanding about the bussiness which is supported by our daily work. .
Before taking about the investment bank, we should have a system understanding of financial market.
we usually divided it into two parts. One is named buy side, the other is named sell side.

Sell and Buy? What is the meanings of those words?

When we talk about buy side, we usually talk about asset management.
There are two major markets, one is private market where we can have venture capital and private equity. the other is secondary market, where we can have mutual fund and hedge fund.

Different from buy side, sell side contains the investment banking and sales&trading. in a broad sense , those two parts can be included in investment bank.
As for investment banking,it is traditional bussness for investment bank. it involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions (M&A). We may be familiar with IPO, initial public offering, which is a bussiness for investment bank in stock market.
For sales and trading, On behalf of the bank and its clients, a large investment bank's primary function is buying and selling products. In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products with the goal of making money on each trade.

comparing these two side,the buy side may have a more comfortble working enviroment.

I hope all of you will enjoy this, thank you.
