HI everybody.
This is my first time to give you guys a speech for Toast Master. I¡¯ve spent a lot of time last weekends to think about a theme to prepare, actually, I find that it is more difficult to do it than to talk about it.  
As we all know, we do not take care of something which seems not very important or crucial for our present daily work, for example, preparing for Toast Master and writing my thesis.
So I am just wondering whether our guys ignored something important in our daily life.
How well our guys understand some essential business concepts?
We are now a member of CSTC, which is owned by Citi Group, many things about organization structures, I am not very clear until I came here. Our department is working for ICG, which include corporate and investment banking, private banking and the rest of the business, you can have a look at Citi official website.
I have one question, what is investment bank?
We can get some information from the literal meaning, but it is not enough for us to get a better understanding about the investment bank.
I want to give you a simple introduction for it and I hope it can help you to build a system understanding for businesses which is supported by our daily works.
When we talk about Investment bank, we usually divided it into two parts. One is named buy side, another is named sell side.
We also are spilt to front office, middle office, and back office activities. Today, I¡¯d just want to talk about the first one.
Sell and Buy? What is the meanings of those words?

When we talk about buy side, we usually talk about asset management.
There are two major markets, one is private market where we can have venture capital and private equity. Another is secondary market, where we can have mutual fund and hedge fund.

Different from buy side, sell side contains the investment banking and sales&trading.
As for investment banking, it involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and so on. We may be familiar with IPO, initial public offer.
For sales and trading, On behalf of the bank and its clients, a large investment bank's primary function is buying and selling products. In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products with the goal of making money on each trade.

Sell side will make many reports to tell trends of  

I guess our PMC and GSM¡¯s information is used for sell side¡®s sales and trading or maybe used in buy side, in secondary market for mutual fund or hedge fund.

I hope you enjoy this, thank you.
